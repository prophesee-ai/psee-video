Prophesee FPGA-based Media Video Device
=================================

Video Media Controller node
---------------------------

This is the media controller node for video capture support. It is a big blob
integrating the sensor control interface and re-mapping the sensor regbanks into
its own. It relies on standard DMA implementation (dmaengine compatible) to make
video data available to the user.

Required properties:
  - compatible: should be "psee,video".
  - reg: physical base address of FPGA registers and length of memory mapped
    region.
  - dmas: list of DMA and channel numbers that the driver may use.
  - dma-names: identifiers for the DMA channels. The driver will use the channel
    called "output" to get the event stream out of the video IP.

example:

ps_m_axi_lite_o@a0000000 {
	compatible ="psee,video";
	reg = <0x0 0xa0000000 0x0 0x1000000>;
	dmas = <&axi_dma 0
		&axi_dma 1>;
	dma-names = "input", "output";
};
